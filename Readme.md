# Web Scraping Projects 🕷️

This repository contains basic web scraping projects built with Python using libraries like `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and more. As a college student, this is part of my journey to explore data extraction, HTML structure, and automation.

## 🧠 What You’ll Find Here

- `web_scraper.py` — A Python script to scrape article titles from websites (e.g., Blackcoffer).
- `headers.py` — For storing request headers to avoid detection.
- `index.html` — A beautiful static HTML page with styled lyrics.
- `album_cover.jpg` — An album art image used in the `sweater_weather.html` file.

## 🎨 Sweater Weather HTML Page

A fun side project to experiment with HTML and CSS layout.
